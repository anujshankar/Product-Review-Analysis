      "Content": "English teachers who work with native speakers of other languages will be thrilled with these flash cards. They are handsomely printed on durable stock with a protective coating for years of shuffling. I've been making my own for over twenty years, but the result has never approached the artful and clear design of these sturdy and compact cards. Students of linguistics should also find these cards useful for developing fluency in IPA transcription.The transcription of the example words for English is a nice compromise between overly broad and unnecessarily narrow. Diacritics, for example, are largely limited to markers of length and syllabicity. A General American accent is the model; primary and secondary stress are marked, as are syllable boundaries. For most ESOL/EFL teachers (at least in the US), the 43 cards covering all the sounds of American English will get the most use, and they are conveniently color-coded (Deck 2) to distinguish them from the rest. Linguistics students will likely spend more time with the other two decks, one with the symbol on one side and its phonetic description on the reverse, and the other giving the names for the individual symbols. The decision to separate into decks and package all three decks together was both generous and wise: for a slightly higher price, you have the capability to accurately describe the languages of any of your students, even if they hail from South Sudan!One might complain that a tool for teaching the sounds of a language should actually make those sounds audibly. (Perhaps the folks at Minokidowinan already have an app for the iPhone in the works!) But really, the task to which these flashcards are best suited is improving the fluency of phonetic transcription, which is, after all, necessarily a written exercise.",

      "Content": "While I have a pretty limited knowledge of phonetics/linguistics as a formal discipline, I entered a drawing to win a set of  these cards, because although I have rudimentary knowledge about the IPA, I have always been very interested in it.  These cards make learning and understanding the international phonetic alphabet accessible, and not intimidating.  The three different decks break down each symbol into three components- the phonetic description, transcriptions, and the symbol name.  This breakdown allows you to focus on studying one component without being inundated with too much information, which is helpful if you've just been introduced to the IPA/ phonetics study, and allows you advance your study at your own rate.  The cards are clear and concise, and laid out nicely!  I've really been enjoying using and learning these cards!",

      "Content": "I'm starting my Masters in Teaching English as a Second Language so I wanted something to help me with studying the phonetic alphabet.  These cards are ok, but I wish for the price they would have a little more information.  They give you the mere basics you would expect from flash cards and do not give much more explanation.  That would be fine if I wasn't paying almost 60$ for them. There are many complex terms on the cards that they do not explain at all.  SO not a bad set, but I would have liked them to be a bit more in depth than they are.  Other than that they are made well and have a good organization system.",

      "Content": "As one with a Bachelor's in Linguistics and much exposure to the world's languages, I have to say these flash cards are excellent.  They are broken down into 3 different flash card types, each one helpful in its own way to mastering the phonetics of the world's languages.  My only disclaimer would be that these cards do require some base-level prerequisite linguistic knowledge.  For example, one set of the cards provides the IPA symbol on one side and the description of the sound on the other.  If you are not familiar with basic phrases used in phonetics like \"central, back, closed, rounded,\" etc... you may have to do some research before using the cards, because there is not an in-depth explanation on the cards.  It is this simplicity and organization of the cards that I actually greatly appreciate.  Lastly, these cards may seem a little pricey... I will say that I think it is worth it.  These cards are made to last and they are a great tool for learning, teaching, using with non-native speakers of a language, using for students learning other languages, etc.  I would recommend these cards to anyone interested in linguistics, learning a new language, or teaching.",

      "Content": "I bought a 12-inch Powerbook after I gave my old Sony Vaio notebook the Pete Townshend treatment - I put my fist through it. (Yes, it looks like a stained glass window.) I hadn't used a Mac in years, but I decided I'd had it with Microsoft and Windows. All it took was one weekend and a good book - \"Mac OS X: The Missing Manual,\" by David Pogue -however, and I mastered the machine.SOFTWAREThe computer comes with some great software. iTunes is the best media player on the market. I have almost 5,000 songs stored on mine. With the search function and browser display, it is easy to find a particular song. iTunes also keeps track of the number of times you've listened to a song and it allows you to rate your songs. It's easy to create a playlist. Also, burning one of those playlists onto a CD can be done with one click.Safari is a great web browser. It has a Google search box built into the toolbar, prevents pop-up ads (I've never had one), has tabbed browsing (preventing a cluttered desktop), and allows for bookmarks to be added with one click.iChat allows Mac users to customize their AIM and Rendezvous chat sessions in ways that the normal applications don't allow, such as adding pictures from iPhoto to their profile.I haven't mastered iPhoto yet, but it is downloading pictures from a digital camera is as easy as plugging it into the USB port and clicking a button.Also, Macs are less likely to get a virus or be overtaken by spyware.The iCal and Address Book look good, but if you are going to sync a PDA with your Mac, you are better off using Palm Desktop software. Hopefully the functionality of those programs will be improved in the future though.Finally, most of the programs work with each other. For example, if someone on my iChat buddy list is online, a green dot will appear next to a message from him or her in my Mail inbox.I also use Microsoft Office, Quicken, Dreamweaver MX, and Palm Desktop - they all work well on the Mac. Office shares files perfectly with PCs.HARDWARESpend the money and get the superdrive (CD-RW/DVD-R). DVDs have more memory than CDs and blank DVD-Rs are becoming more affordable. If you are into collecting videos of concerts, a DVD-R is a must.I'd recommend upgrading to at least 768 MB of memory and the 80 GB hard drive. Burning a DVD requires a lot of memory and can take a while - this way you can use other applications while burning a DVD (on my old PC, if I was burning a CD, I couldn't use anything else). The hard drive space is really cheap. Plus, if you load your CDs on your computer, they can eat up a lot of memory, even as MP3s (my 5,000 songs take up about 25 GB).Also, there is a lot to be said for getting the Airport Exteme card (although you can buy a third-party base station for less). I am able to browse the Internet in any room of my house - well worth the extra $100 or so.I have the 12-inch monitor, but that was because Apple hadn't released the 15-inch in the new style when I made my purchase. The 12-inch is fine - it's much clearer than my old PC notebook - but if I had the opportunity, I'd probably go with the bigger monitor.DRAWBACKS-While most software is available for Mac OS X, there are some programs that aren't (Google toolbar, Yahoo! toolbar, Kazaa, AvantGo) or minor problems in software that is available (Quicken can't access accounts on Ameritrade via Macs)-The PowerBook doesn't have a fan, which is great for the battery, but can cause it to get a bit hot underneath where the user rests his left hand.Regardless of those drawbacks, however, buying a Mac was an easy decision. If you have any questions about it, click on my profile and send me a e-mail.UPDATE: After 14 months, the hard drive started making noise and system performance got slow and I couldn't run as many programs as I used to. I called Apple and had to spend $300 for them to put in a new hard drive and some other hardware. They were unable to transfer my data to my new hard drive, so I've spent the past four days reloading all of my software and applications. No idea why the hard drive went. Hence I dropped the rating from five stars to four.",

      "Content": "Finally retired my Sony Vaio (850Mhz) and made the switch to a powerbook--wanted to do that ever since I realized that Mac OS X is pretty much BSD Unix with a killer desktop.  What a great machine this is. Much better than the comparable IBook...twice the processor cache for starters...and none of the problems that have plagued the 1Gz iBook.  Weighs just 4.6 pounds and is very portable...aluminium case is very scratch resistant.  I get GREAT range with the add-on Airport Extreme card going to a LinkSys 11g access point (there's an antenna in the lid of the unit).  I'm very happy with the battery life, the operating system, and the apps I use on this machine (Office X mostly).  About a month after getting and using this machine I got a G5 for my desktop and I'm quite happy.  If you're looking for a gaming rig, forget Apple but if you're looking for a business-oriented machine that fits in very smoothly with a PC-based office, this is the ticket. Networks much easier than a Windows machine!",

Compared to the first 12-inch PowerBook, it runs cooler and is quite a bit snappier. Plus it supports DVI out and USB 2.That said, its battery life and Airport range are not quite as good as an iBook's. So unless you're going to do a lot of serious video/graphics work, you may want to consider one of the new G4 iBooks -- they're great machines for the price.Really, you can't go wrong either way, depending on your needs.",

I had a 15\" TI and experienced most of the normal complaints one reads about in the various message boards (heat, bad paint). Given the vast differences between M$ products and the way the Apple performed, my sanity said go for it!To sum up. The aluminum case, the size, the reliability make it worth it. It's a head turner. I get lots of comments in Starbucks when I check e-mails and do some work. My only advice would be to invest in a good case. The latch is flimsy and probably will fail if you carry the Pbook around naked a lot. The Airport Extreme card is a worthwhile accessory, too. So many places have 802.11 access these days. There are also after market car and airline chargers available which will effectively allow you to work from the time you leave your office and fly to a far off destination. Battery life is good so far. From talking to other owners and personal experience, I recommend going with the manual recomendations. I consistently get between two and three hours depending on what I am doing. I would expect two years of usage from this notebook. By that time, Jobs and Company will have something faster and better that you won't be able to live without.",

Everything actually does what you tell it to and almost instantaneously.I have made the adjustments without all that much hassle.Thought I might mind the smaller screen but not at all.Within the first week-I had done mail,gone on the internet,installed my mouse,the font I wanted,had it reading stuff for me,installed games,have it tell me the time etc etc etc.It is that user friendly.There is just too much to love about it to even list.I would NEVER go back to any other pc again!I am in computer heaven!",

It has a good metallic design and its size is very easy to carry around, this is the major disadvantage of larger bulkier notebooks. I have had mine upgraded to 1.25 GB Ram, and the performance of applications like Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop is great. You can even play games like Halo on it pretty well, if that is your thing. You can have up to 80GB of HD, and my advice is to buy the largest you can afford. I also have an Airport (802.11g) card installed, and it allows wireless connectivity with a pretty good range. In addition, Bluetooth built-in allowed me to use a very nice wireless mouse with it.  The Keyboard is of good quality, an important feature if you have to write long documents in Word! The LCD screen is of good quality too. All in all it made a pleasant switch from my previous bulky Sony Vaio Lap.  I would recommend this computer very highly.",

      "Content": "Yeah, I know it's a little more money than the knock-off PC clones from Dell and Gateway, but this is a far superior computer. The Mac platform is not only the most powerful one available, it is also the simplest and most versatile - once you learn it.The 15-inch is the perfect size for me. I looked at both the 12 and 17-inch models and felt they were a little too small/big respectively. There is something attractive about the 12 inch - a friend of mine has one and he carries it around everywhere, able to write anywhere anytime. And seated at a desk the 17-inch is also attractive, presenting a massive, bright screen to work on. But all in all, the 15-inch provides the best both worlds. It's very portable - maybe not as easy to tug along as the 12-inch, but certainly manageable with a small backpack. The 17-inch can be problematic on a plane if there are people crowding you, and it's certainly cumbersome to maneuver in tight spaces, whereas the 12-inch is easy to maneuver but can cause a little eyestrain from a distance.I definitely recommend a Mac, first of all, and within that I recommend the 15-inch G4 notebook. If you must have a 12-inch, you might take a look at the 12-inch iBook, which is cheaper but obviously not as feature rich (the iBook's graphics card is not as powerful and the processor is slower, most notably).The complaints I have are exterior - the computer doesn't age well (i.e., it nicks and scratches rather easily) and there should be some sort of elevation device to raise the back end while typing (like the older Powerbooks had).All in all you can't go wrong with any Apple laptop you choose. They are truly making the digital life a reality with all of their integrated software - iTunes, iPhoto, iSight, and the iPod are particularly cool. No other laptop will have an operating system with so many fantastic programs that are so perfectly integrated together. If this is remotely in your price range, go for it. It can literally change the way you operate on a day-to-day basis.",

The unit itself is built solid as a rock, very durable but once you turn it on and try to use the features you are quickly frustrated by the lack of user friendliness and the terrible lack of memory. You constantly have to go into task manager, thats right task manager (this is a miniature version of the windows that you use on your computer) and close tasks to get the camera to function. If you have one too many things open it won't work AND when you exit back to the home screen the phone does not automatically close Apps you were using, they stay running in the backround and have to manually be closed in task manager. The keyboard was an awkward size for my fingers and to send a text you have to go to MESSAGES, then MENU, then select the type of message, E mail or SMS or MMS, THEN you have to go to folders and select NEW. It a 3 or 4 step process just to text vs just hitting an icon and going to town. The camera takes decent pics for a low pix unit but like I said you have to make sure you keep the memory clear. It's just a terrible operating system, totally inefficiant. I definitely would not recommend this phone.The dust cover for the charging port broke off the second day. I have already returned mine.",

      "Content": "I recently bought the nook HD white for 129 greenbacks from BN. I had originally purchased a Kindle Fire HD. The Nook is lighter and the screen is brighter/sharper than the Kindle Fire. With the recent update to allow the full version of Google Play, a lot of the original limitations with the Nook have gone away. The chrome browser beats Silk all the way. You can actually download the Kindle App from the Google appstore and read all the books. However, you cannot install the amazon appstore and I had to buy some of the apps from Google play that I had originally purchased. There are no ads with the nook. Even with the Fathers day sale (which put the Kindle no-ad version at 195), this is cheaper by 65 bucks. An additional benefit is you can add an external SD card and there are options to boot a full blown standard Android Jellybean from the SD card with the nook from places like (AFN - android for nook for just 10 bucks).The two main downsides are that it lacks a front facing camera, but I really have no use for that and the parental controls are not that easy to set as in the Kindle (you can create a child profile and make sure that the password has to be entered, but I have not fully figured it out).I liked it so much that I bought a second nook in smoke color today.",

      "Overall": "5.0",
      "Content": "I picked up the Nook HD yesterday from B&N;, they still had plenty in stock at my local store.  With the price drop they had down to $79 (might have been temporary for Black Friday weekend) I ran out of excuses not to buy it.  I'm still using my old Nook color as an ereader and this price I couldn't resist getting a nice upgrade.Here is what is great about this tablet, you get a decent stock operating system now that B&N; allows access to the Google Play store and apps.  Right out of the box, it is very nice already.  But for tinkerers like myself, the best thing is to set it up with a custom Android ROM, there is a great one called Cyanogenmod 10.1 - this is basically a stock Android 4.2.2 set up to run on the Nook HD - gives you an interface and user experience much like what you get on the new model Nexus 7.  I requires some computer skills and a 4GB or bigger microSD card, took me about 30 minutes to do.There are plenty of tutorials/directions online, it is not terribly difficult for anyone who is even mildly computer savvy.  The most important thing to do for the sake of being able to go back to stock - for warranty or any reason - is to use a recovery tool to first back up the stock B&N; ROM before you flash the tablet with the custom ROM.  The same recovery program that I used to flash the custom ROM has an option right in the menu to create a backup of the stock ROM right onto the microSD card, pretty easy.While I decided to completely overwrite the stock B&N; ROM, there is also an option to set up a microSD card with a custom ROM and you can then basically dual-boot and not even affect the stock B&N; ROM.  Take out the SD card and reboot the tablet and you are back to a totally stock Nook HD.  Again, plenty of tutorials online that explain how to go about doing all of this stuff.Functionally the Nook HD with Cyanogenmod 10.1 is probably 90% of what the 2013 Nexus 7 does at less than half the cost.  The biggest glaring difference is the lack of any cameras, it has neither front or back - but to be honest I never used them on the several years that I have owned tablets except for a couple of times to Skype.  For photos and video I whip out the phone, which is always in my pocket, better sized for that purpose, and equipped with far superior camera lenses and sensors.  The Nook HD with my custom ROM is running a fairly new Android version and is sufficiently fast enough for anything I need it to do, read books, play games, web surf, Netflix, etc.  The screen resolution on the Nook HD is just right for a 7 inch tablet, as somebody who has also owned/owns a Nexus 10, Samsung GS4, and Moto X, I can tell you that anything above 250 ppi starts to really get to a point of diminishing returns.  The added sharpness is barely perceptible and you need a lot more horsepower from your device to power the screen plus you incur more battery drain.On the Nook HD, I can load a full webpage and read text pretty comfortably without having to zoom in.  This is very serviceable for doing just about anything but a high resolution 9\" to 10\" screen is definitely the better way to go for frequently viewing larger content like webpages and digital magazines.  This serves my purpose better since my priority was a lighter and smaller tablet that I slide in the back pocket and can easily hold in one hand to read books, etc.The obvious point I am trying to make is that for $80-$100, you will not find a better 7\" tablet, especially if you mod it with a good Android ROM.  In summary, I'll list out the positives and negatives at the end of this review.  Most of the negatives are honestly minor especially when factoring price, but I'll be critical and point out every little thing that I have observed.  Take the negatives with a grain of salt, I am still rating this as a 5 star product.I would love to be able to really solidify this review further by comparing this directly with the Kindle Fire HD but I'm not sure that is even necessary.  Even without having used a Kindle Fire HD, I find the Nook HD to be a likely easy winner between the two since it is typically cheaper, has a higher resolution screen, slightly faster CPU, offers a microSD slot, and is less locked down even in stock form now that the stock B&N; ROM lets you into the Google Play store (the Kindle Fire HD can also be tweaked to do this and of course you can go the full route of installing a custom ROM on that as well).  You don't lose any of the great Amazon stuff with this tablet.  Download the Kindle app and you can buy and read books through Amazon's Kindle store.  Download the Boat Browser from the Google Play store, turn on the flash plugin in settings, and you can watch Amazon Prime videos.Okay, enough said - here's the summary:PROS:-Price, as long as it is being sold for ~$100 or less.-Sufficiently powerful CPU/hardware specs to do most everything without any noticeable lag or performance issues.  Very zippy with the custom ROM I installed (Cyanogenmod 10.1).  Video playback is excellent, I'm able to stream 720p on my network without issues.-Excellent screen, color and sharpness is superb, gets as bright as I need it to indoors in any lighting (have not tested outdoors).-Build quality seems good, tablet feels tight and solid overall, buttons feel tight and solid also.-Touchscreen is accurate and responsive.-Light and comfortable to hold, soft concave rubberized back is very nice.-Stereo speakers are rear facing but suitably loud and clear sounding without my having to do the 'hand cupping' to direct the sound forward.-MicroSD card slot means you can expand memory up to 64GB or run custom ROMs without having to permanently install them.-Proprietary charging cable has a larger much more robust connector than the flimsy microUSB plug most android tablets use (which I hate despite the advantage of being 'universal' and cheap to replace).CONS:-Having to use an flashed or SD card based custom ROM to get rid of the B&N; limited version of android and get the full android experience (not everyone can or wants to do this).-No cameras-MicroSD card slot cover is total crap, takes a lot of effort to pry open and you feel like you will end up tearing it off by mistake.  Fortunately most people won't need to mess with it more than a few times - once you have your microSD card in there it can be left alone.-Shiny plastic they used around the outer edge of the bezel and the microSD slot cover looks really cheap.  Fortunately the front part of the bezel (which is probably the same plastic) has a nicer looking matte finish.  Design is dull and simple looking.  Not thick but not exactly super thin or 'svelte' looking.-Volume buttons are a little awkward due being positioned a little too close to the corner for comfort and also being tilted away from the index finger because of the beveled angle of the bezel, plus they take a bit of effort to depress.-Proprietary charging cable and it will not charge from computer USB port apparently - because of this it is probably a good idea to buy a spare cable but they are still way overpriced.-Proprietary HDMI adapter for video output is also expensive, way overpriced.",

      "Content": "I had given my kids a Nook Color a couple years ago. Sold it last fall and got 1 girl a Kindle Fire 2nd gen, and the other a Lenovo A2107. The Lenovo was absolutely horrid so I wanted to replace it. This summer, when the Nook HD got Google Play, and the prices fell, I sold the Lenovo and got my daughter the Nook HD 16gb Snow. She absolutely loves it! I liked it so much, I got the Nook HD 8gb for myself. I like it much better than my Kindle Fire HD. The size is smaller, and thinner, and lighter, which are great things. And you can put whatever wallpaper you want on it, unlike the Fire HD.I sold the 2nd gen Kindle Fire and gave the other daughter the Fire HD, but she has since switched to a Nook also (HD+). So now I have the Fire HD and the Nook HD for myself. I like the Nook HD better for the reasons stated above. Size and weight are so much smaller on the Nook HD. The screen resolution is also better. There is nothing I don't like about the Nook HD. I did put a GreatShield Glare Screen protector on the Nooks, to reduce the shiny glare. We use them without cases, just sleeves. They are phenomenal tablets.If you or the person you are buying for loves to play games and will likely download hundreds of them, definitely get the 16gb Nook HD. You will want as much space for apps as you can afford, despite the SD card slot. Games have to be installed to internal memory, for the most part. The SD card slot comes in handy for books, movies, photos and music. I got the 8 gb Nook HD for myself, because I don't play games, the only apps I need are for reading, playing music, news, web, stuff like that. I put my files on the SD card and I am set!I don't plan to buy the new Fires when they come out.  They are far too limited, in my opinion. (So was the Nook, of course, until they added Google Play). I have ADW Launcher on all three of the Nooks, though my daughters tend to prefer the standard Nook launcher. What shows up on that home page can be customized to show only what you want it to show. There is also an \"app drawer\" icon that shows the most recently opened apps for easy launching. It really is a great design, and far superior to the tiresome carousel on the Kindle Fires.",

      "Content": "I would recommend the Nook HD to anyone. I had a Nook Color for 3 years and didn't have a single problem with it until the battery charge indicator started to malfunction, which is when I purchased the HD. I'm glad I did, as it's lighter, faster, and has that beautiful HD screen.As an e-reader, the text is crystal clear and pristine. As a tablet, it's quick, easy to navigate, and has a spectacular picture. I find it very user-friendly and intuitive to download books, read, and organize my book \"shelves.\" I also appreciate being able to download books from Project Gutenberg and other free sites and the public library directly onto the Nook using the Wi-Fi feature instead of having to use a USB cord to plug into my computer. You can also rent or buy movies to watch on the spectacular HD screen.I enjoyed the experience of going to a store and seeing the different Nooks that are offered and asking questions from the representatives there. I can't imagine purchasing an e-reader without touching it, feeling it, and testing it out before deciding which one I wanted.  If you're debating between the Simple Touch and the HD, I would recommend the HD: you get a tablet for the price of an e-reader, you don't have to use your computer to \"sideload\" content from sites other than B&N;, and you get a much crisper and more legible reading screen that you can read in the dark at night.I don't think that I'll ever be without a Nook in the future.  I thought that I was married to actual books, but the Nook really captures the book experience. It's like having an entire library at your disposal in the comfort of your own home. It's also amazing that you can carry a giant, epic 3-inch-thick piece of literature in a slim little e-reader.  If you're hesitating on making this purchase, I say go for it. You won't be disappointed.",

If you think you are getting the same type of speedy 7\" tablet as a Nexus 7 (especially the 2013 refresh), you are going to be disappointed.  First off, it's an older model.  Second, it's got different internal components, which is why you can get it for under $120. Lastly, the Nook launcher/overlay is just more of an obstacle than a help.2. It's still a great value, IF you are planning on using it for reading, watching Netflix or Hulu, or for CONSUMING media.  It's not a creation-based device, but so few people create content, I think the market is still there for this device.3. Throw in a 16 or 32 GB microSD card and enjoy a LOT more room for your own media than what Nexus or Apple will give you in one of there devices. I went with the 8GB device and now have almost 40 with the expandable memory.4. It's a comfortable device to use, especially if you are already on the Google ecosystem. The only app I really miss having is MLB At Bat, but if you were to root and install an alternate operating system, it might work.  I can't speak to that. I can, however, tell you Google Books, Google Music, and virtually everything else I use for apps works on this device.So, is it worth $120? Yes. Is it the fastest, shiniest, coolest Android tablet on the market? No. That one is going to cost you more than $120. Spend the money, slap some extra memory on this thing, and you really can't go wrong.",

But to my displeasure, Barnes & Noble doesn't allow for any of their tablets to read text books from NOOKStudy (their ebook reading program). It has been a rather irritating discovery because they hide that fact in the fine print.I feel that anyone who is thinking of purchasing this product should know this fact up front. If the user does not intend to use it for that reason, great. But if you do, be warned. This will be a waste of your money.Other than that, it is fine. It runs like an android for internet. My wife and I use it mainly for quick searches and to watch videos. But being run on android programming means it can be slow and cumbersome at times. And you cannot download anything without it being through Nook.If you so choose to buy this product, I recommend a stylus pen to prevent the screen from building an oily film.",

I tried the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (expensive and glitchy), the Lenvovo Idea Tab (poor performance) before I settled on the Nook. After using tablets at both high and low-end price points I figured I had nothing to lose--and was pleasantly surprised by the Nook's capabilities!On the Nook I can read BN or Kindle books, play Scrabble from the Android store, and watch Netflix. More advanced features such as GPS and camera are unnecessary for me, and I enjoy the simplicity of this device. It has a sturdy build and even though I did not want a white tablet (fear of dirt) it has not been an issue. I have had it for several months and don't feel anxious about using it without a cover.It's ease of use, clean interface, adequate battery life, and features make this a winner for me in the under $100 category. Add to that BN's 1-year warranty and I am more than satisfied with my purchase.My only qualm with the Nook HD is that it has a proprietary charging cable (not a micro usb like cell phones) so it is an extra cord to carry when traveling. In addition, it will not fit just any usb plug (something to do with wattage, I think). So if you plug the usb end into a travel charger or car charger it may not work. Same thing with using a usb port on a computer. IMO this is a major limitation for an otherwise great device, especially for someone that travels frequently.",

Sometimes it's just flighty about picking up signal no matter where I am, this happens in phases, especially after I have had to erase and deregister it. I have had to do that six times with this one, in order to get things to work properly. The Bluetooth drains the battery even though it is off. (I own a off brand Bluetooth keyboard, which may have began that problem). These problems drain the battery quite quickly so I my batter doesn't last. And my chargers are quite new. I called to have this second one replaced but there was a display issue with the third one and the headphone jack didn't work so I sent that back. I have stuck with my second one. I know this sounds like a mouth full of problems. But I am always satisfied with the customer service. I know that if I have any serious lasting problems, they will replace it, and also the new year of warranty starts over as soon as I receive the replacement, not dating back to my first one, which I have had since Mother's day 2013.Good things are, the google play enhancement, I use mine so often and it is an excellent tablet for $129. I really enjoy using it for every day utility, budgeting, notes, personal upkeep, audio and regular books. The possibilities seem endless.",

I mainly wanted it for reading books and magazines because I travel, and I chose the nook because it is compatible with my library system in Philadelphia, it can read books from B&N;, plus if you download an app it can read Kindle books. It does do all of these things, but here is why I have grown to hate it:1. Proprietary charger cable. Really? Why? What a pain.2. Sluggish, unresponsive screen. I try to zoom, it registers a click. I try to click, it thinks I am zooming. I have to constantly repeat my touch commands, and then it locks up. In case you are wondering, I use an iPhone every day and have no trouble with that touch screen, so I am not a moron.3. When I read in bed at night and doze off, which is every night (this is why I read in bed, after all) the screen suddenly becomes totally responsive and registers a few hundred page turns, so I wake up to discover that I am way ahead in my book with no way to easily return. This does not happen with my iPhone.I am going back to using the nook and kindle apps on my iPhone, in spite of the small screen. It does mean more page turns, but at least I don't have to manage and pack yet another device and charger when I travel, or be frustrated by an unresponsive interface and buggy Android apps. Plus, the iPhone fits in my pocket.",

      "Content": "I bought this tablet to use mainly as an e-reader because I thought of the portability. I think the 7\" screen is too small for me. I wish it was 8 or 9 inches. However in the overall the Nook Tablet seems nice. I am still exploring all its features.  I find there is a total lack of instruction of how to use them. For example photo transfer from phone to Nook or from Mac to Nook.  There are 2 places were to allocated photos: Gallery and Photos.  The Gallery seems linked directly to a google account. I am still struggling to get through this.  I want to customize the tablet better for my personal use, and I am still learning, thus for the time being I will give it 4 stars.Not all screens of the tablet can be zoomed in either and this is very bad. Barnes and Nobles books reviews about e-books is one of them and this is why I wished I had a larger screen.I have NOT used the Barnes & Noble library download feature, I use Kindle app instead.The e-mail set up is also annoying as well. It assumes user has a gmail account and setting up different emails is not easy. I have fixed this by directly using webmail account access.Not all apps are  available for Nook tablet either. Some of them (quite popular ones as well) are only available for iPad or android phone. I do not understand why since this is an android platform they do not work with Nook. This is something hard to determine previous the purchase of the tablet and until in need of a specific app. Perhaps not necessarily the fault of the tablet manufacturer, but still irritating.I will leave a better detailed review when I learn all the features of the tablet.***UPDATE April 22.2014The more I use the Nook the more I dislike this tablet. I originally graded it 4 stars but a series of technical problems is forcing me to give it 3 stars.Kindle app continuously freezes or crashes.  Tablet reading feature lights up  as problem as well: it seems to get stuck on a low light dim mode and needs to be adjusted frequently.  Since Barnes & Noble library availably of selection is much inferior to the Amazon one in many ways including price of ebooks, Kindle is a must for avid readers.WhatsUp app is not compatible for this tablet either.Skype app works with the Nook but it is almost useless since the tablet lacks of camera. This is NOT a feature I was looking for initially, but I am now.I even downloaded a free office/document program called King Office, which isn't that bad.The tablet syncs automatically with the contact list of android phone but doesn't recognize a cable connection for photo transfer between the phone and tablet.  I truly dislike the sync part where my contacts are displayed on the tablet. I had to manually hide and remove that option.Google+ and Google icons along with Gmail icons populate the tablet and this is also very annoying.  I am still trying to figure out how to completely eliminate that.I will continue to update as I use it but my opinion about this tablet is that if you are looking to go beyond the e-reader use you are going to be somewhat disappointed.",

      "Content": "Purchased this TV at Amazon.com after fiasco with an un-named online retialer. The TV is great. I spent about 3 months researching the field before I made my decision. I made at least 7 trips to Best Buy (not to confuse with bestbuyplasma.com grrrr...) looking at all the Sonys, Samsungs, Sharps, Hitachis, etc.  I have no clue how Best Buy can sell so many TVs these days. Prices are SO MUCH higher there than on Amazon. People either don't do research or too affraid of online purchases. I did pick up Samsung HD DVD player there though, only $20 more than online. I don't remember DVD model, the one that does 720p up-convert and has DVI out.This TV is cheapest you can find in 32\" 720p category that offers tremendous bang for the buck. Some reviews mentioned over-saturated red color, some mentioned flaws in picture quality. This is not true, plain and simple. This TV requires some tunning when unpacked from the box. Duhh... It took me about an hour to go through calibration and tuning. The results are amazing. Use DVI. Use DVI. Can I say it again? DVI is digital connection. Throw away all your fancy Monster Cables. It is unfortunate and makes me feel sad when people say how great DVI Monster cables are. I understand that analog Monster Cables are of high quality while perhaps being too pricey. With digital connection you either have a picture or you don't. There is no \"in-between\": no noise, no color change, no blurring is even possible. I am yet to see a DVI cable that would not transmit 0 and 1. $15 cable from Menards(!) worked just beautifully. Any and all DVI cables are equal.I went with gold plated S-video cable ($10 from Menards) for my older satellite dish that does not have DVI output (waiting for my HD pack now :) S-video is analog signal and requires some care, hence gold.Now bad things (not enough to reduce to 4 stars though): 1. Only one DVI input. I will have to buy DVI switch box.2. Setup: it takes some time to figure out correct set of modes(menus) for true digital (DVI) connection. The trick that helped me resolve the problem was connecting TV via old-fashioned composite cable along with DVI. This allowed for tracking menus even when no pitcure can be seen on DVI input.3. Speakers: I am not a great fan of elephant ears in TVs. TV looks much cleaner without them, fits very well in my not very large room. Combined with ($600) Infinity Total Solutions(TM) 6-Speaker System (TSS-750PLT) this TV is a peice of art in a frame. The downside was that I still had to pay for speakers that now sit in my garage.(...)",

      "Overall": "4.0",
      "Content": "I'm no expert on Televisions, but I've read enough about them to write a useful review for you.  First off, as stated by another reviewer, the response time (16 milliseconds) is one of the fastest available and should be a big selling point for this screen.  Similar screens by other companies such as Dell for example have response times of 20 or 25 milliseconds.  The higher the number, the more \"lag\" or \"ghosts\" will be seen while watching movies.  Be sure to ask about response times of any LCD screens you look at.  I bought this TV over amazon.com and overall I'm very satisfied.  I mainly view DVD's, video games and surf the internet with mine.  I don't watch television much so I can't give you a review of that.  From what I've read, LCD screens are not the greatest for regular television viewing; however, HDTV will look awesome as soon as it becomes the standard.  Here is the equipment I'm using:  I have a samsung HDTV dvd upconverter player.  It's a newer dvd player that enhances standard dvd's up to minimum HDTV standards (720p or 1080i).  I used the DVI connection via a $100 monster cable which can be found on amazon.  It doesn't pay to own this TV if you plan on viewing anything with composite (S-video) connections.  The component video is extremely better especially hooked up to a progressive scan dvd player (480p).  When viewing DVD's through my player, there wasn't much difference between picture quality using the DVI input (720p or 1080i) or the progressive scan component connection (480p).  This is only true because of the DVD player I'm using; DVI is still the best connection you can get for any TV.  The DVI input for this TV should be a major selling point because it will be used for any HDTV signal.I rate movie viewing 4 stars because of a few flaws.  The flaws can be seen while watching older dvds.  Most movies looked great from start to finish except during certain scenes:  I watched \"Good morning vietnam\" in (480p) and the picture experienced some lag.  The actors lips were not moving along to the audio; the picture was trying to catch up to the dialogue - very annoying.  The same thing was experience while watching a newer dvd entitled \"Cabin fever\" in (720p).  Whenever a movie had fog or rain or mist in the foreground around the actors like in \"Master and Commander\", the image would get somewhat grainy in (720p); however, the rest of the movie looked great.  Aside from that, other movies seemed to look great from begining to end.  All three Lord of the Rings movies looked stunning in (720p) - hardly any flaws; the same was true with all three matrix movies.  Overall, it is a good set to watch movies on, but it depends upon the quality of your player, the connections and the quality of the DVD.  Older dvd's experienced alot of lag along with a few newer ones.  But, a majority of newer dvd's (from the last 5-7 years) looked great.  They looked better than a CRT model - using my set up.I feel that the real great thing about this TV is the ability to hook it up your computer.  You no longer have to sit in front of a little 15, 17 or whatever sized screen.  You can sit on your couch, put the keyboard in your lap, and surf the net on a 32\" just like you were watching TV.  If you use a computer often for the net or typing or even PC gaming, this is definatly the TV to buy.  The computer image was flawless.  I play simcity4 and it looks amazing.  Again, the equipment you hook up can play a big difference in the results you get.  I have a 2.4ghz Dell 4600 with a DVI output.  I haven't hooked up the PC via component connection yet and I don't know if you can. This is more than just a TV, it's a huge computer monitor and this was the main selling point for me.  Highly recommended for PC use.Lastly, video games look amazing as well.  I have my Xbox hooked up through a high definition pack via a component connection.  Games such as Halo, Tigerwoods 2004, Unreal Championship, Splinter cell etc. look crisper and cleaner than on any CRT that I've seen.  I've played xbox on a samsung 30\" HDTV CRT with the high definition pack and this LCD screen still looks better.  Overall, This is a good buy.  I have a few complaints about some movies, but most have no problem with lag.  This could have something to do with the player I'm using so don't let that discourage you from buying this.  One thing to keep in mind is that as time goes on, dvds will increase in picture quality up until high definition dvds comes out.  As soon as that happens, this TV shouldn't experience any lag at all - hopefully.",

The box is huge, but the set is optimally sized, with the case not much larger than the screen. The detachable speakers have stayed in the box, which was a selling point for me. Wish I could have bought the screen more cheaply without the speakers at all. The connections are pretty robust, yet it took me several attempts to bring up an image. I'm neither the biggest geek nor the biggest technophobe, so getting the devices to communicate was less obvious than I may have preferred but ultimately do-able. So many options can turn into a tragedy of riches.Picture quality is quite good but quite different from the blur of a CRT. It's very bright, which works well for dark images, and it gets over ambient light very well. The composite connection yields really poor results, but who really expects to use that? The component connection is far, far better, but even that reveals screen artifacts unknown in a CRT, such as the distortion of lines moving across the screen. Progressive scan DVD players are reported to improve this (I don't yet own one).Without a lot of video sources or comparisons to other LCD or plasma, I can't reliably steer a potential buyer toward or away from this product, but aside from a few minor quibbles, I'm quite happy thus far with mine.",

This eliminates the voltage drop from the 100' run of the light gage power wire contained in this cable. This should be included as a note on the cable packaging for this length of cable.
